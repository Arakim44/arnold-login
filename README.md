### about

Arnold:Workout App is a website Where you can Schedule workouts in weekely basis. We used passport.js library in order to authenticate users, and stored the user's data into MySQL database through using sequalize library. The Handlebars were utilized as template to render the page for different users.

For the future development, I am hoping to add calendar to the webpage and be able to add workouts for future weeks ahead for each users, and keep in track of leader boards for the workout points that has accomplished.
